      <h2>What is Exodus Swap?</h2>

      <p>Exodus Swap allows you to connect to our third-party exchange API providers inside your Exodus wallet to swap
        250+ supported crypto assets.</p>

      <p>With Exodus, you can conduct swaps from within your self-custody wallet. You control if, when, and how much of
        your crypto will pass into the custody of a third-party exchange API provider, unlike centralized platforms.</p>

      <p>When you swap crypto, your chosen crypto is sent to the wallet of the third-party exchange API provider
        facilitating the order. This is an on-chain transaction and incurs a network transaction fee. When your swap is
        completed, you receive the swapped crypto back in your wallet.</p>
