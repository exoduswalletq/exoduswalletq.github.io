      <h2>What is Exodus Wallet?</h2>

      <p>Exodus is a decentralized exchange and wallet founded in 2015 by J.P. Richardson and Daniel Castagnoni.

      <p>Exodus and Coinbase are cryptocurrency exchanges offering digital wallets, staking, and a variety of
        cryptocurrencies. Exodus was founded in 2015 with headquarters in Nebraska, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
        Commission (SEC) approved its offering of Class A common stock in April 2021 (OTCBB: EXOD). Coinbase launched in
        2012 and was previously headquartered in California. However, in 2020, it announced Coinbase would be a
        remote-first company and plans to close its San Francisco headquarters by 2022. It went public via a direct
        listing in April 2021 (Nasdaq: COIN).</p>

      <h2>Is Exodus Wallet Safe?</h2>
